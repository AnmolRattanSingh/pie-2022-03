# Divide and Conquer
Barbot takes advantage of three very important systems: Mechanical; Electrical; Firmware. In developing the BarBot, we had to make sure that the electrical and firmware architecture was ready to recieve the motor assemblies that would carry our drink dispensing pumps.

Mechanical: In charge of pump assembly development
Electrical: In charge of creating and optimizing circuitry
Firmware: In charge or creating and optimizing the dispensing and user interface.
