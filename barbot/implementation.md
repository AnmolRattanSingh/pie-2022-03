# Increment Steps
Working up to the currently functioning BarBot came involved building up the pump assembly, electronics, and the firmware in parallel to allow continual testing. 

The following is a breakdown on the actual sprints taken to get a working BarBot

_TODO: Create the sites for the three sprints and create embedded links to them here_

## Sprints

_For now..._

[Sprint 1](/implementation/sprint1)

[Sprint 2](/implementation/sprint2)

[Sprint 3](/implementation/sprint3)

_TODO: Add images that show some progress from Sprint 1 to Sprint 3_

## Budget Distribution

_TODO: Describe original budgetting_

_TODO: Link to a view-only budget spreadsheet (even better, embedded spreadsheet)_
